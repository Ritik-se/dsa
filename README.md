ðŸš€ DSA in Java â€“ Daily Practice
This repository contains my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions written in Java.
Iâ€™m maintaining this repo with daily consistency to track my learning journey, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews.

This is mainly my learning repo, but suggestions, optimizations, and new problems are always welcome.
Feel free to open an Issue or a Pull Request.
